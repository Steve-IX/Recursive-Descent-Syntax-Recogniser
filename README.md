# Recursive-Descent-Syntax-Recogniser
A lightweight Java project that implements the syntax-analysis phase of a tiny Ada-like language compiler. It uses a hand-written recursive-descent parser to recognise the grammar supplied in the coursework brief and reports the first syntax error with contextual, line-accurate messages.
